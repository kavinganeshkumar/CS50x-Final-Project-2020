## My Project 
For my final project I created a Pomodoro Timer which is a tool used for the Pomodoro Method. The Pomodoro is a productivity method where you do 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of free time. I created 2 timers, one for work and one for when you take a break. Both timers have a clock, a start, pause, and stop button. The languages which I used for this project were plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
