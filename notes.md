## What It Needs to Do (The Basics)

    - Needs to start a 25 minute timer, and the timer will go off once 25 is over
    - Will start a few minute timer after the 25 minutes is done
    - you can reset the clock after each session
    - There are buttons to start, stop, and pause the timer

## Novelties (Things that would be nice to have)

    - A way to customize the amount of time that the session is but still while following the 5:1 ratio (or not)
    - Some sort of sound or image that plays once the 25 minutes and 5 minutes (signalling the end of the timer)

## The Design / Layout

    - Something simple and clean
    - The timer is shown on the screen
    - there are + and - buttons to increase the time
    - there is a reset button
    - some sort of static image behind the timer or some sort of animated clock that shows the time going down
